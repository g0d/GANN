An alternative kind of ANN introduced by George Delaportas in 2006, that predates most of the innovations recently found in Tensor Flow and other ANN libraries in 2022.

Actually, GANN is not just another ANN but rather a framework that creates and trains this new ANN automatically based on certain criteria and mathematical models that were invented explicitly for this purpose.
